## Python for Data analysis & Data Science

 - It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application.
 - Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function. 
 - It provides great libraries to deals with data science application.
 - Not only deep learning frameworks available with Python APIs but the scientific packages have made Python incredibly 
   productive and versatile.
 - ML scientists prefer Python as well
 - Applications like natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, developers opted for Python, because it 
   provides large collection of libraries that help to solve complex business problem easily, build strong system and 
   data application.
 - Most Commonly used libraries for data science:
    - Numpy
        - NumPy stands for Numerical Python
        - Numpy is Python library that provides mathematical function to handle large dimension array.
    - Pandas
        - Pandas is one of the most popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
        - There two data structures in Pandas
            Series – It Handle and store data in one-dimensional data.
            DataFrame – It Handle and store Two dimensional data. 
    - Matpotlib
        - Matplolib is another useful Python library for Data Visualization        
    - Scipy
        - Scipy is another popular Python library for data science and scientific computing. 
        - Scipy provides great functionality to scientific mathematics and computing programming
    - Scikit–learn
        - Sklearn is Python library for machine learning. 
        - Sklearn provides various algorithms and functions that are used in machine learning. 
        - Sklearn is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
