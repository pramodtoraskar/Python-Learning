# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. 
Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

The programming challenge was seen as how to write the logic, not how to define the data. 
Object-oriented programming takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
